# Meta Diff UI
![CI](https://github.com/ScottG489/metadiff-ui/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Development
To start the local server for development run `npm start`

To run the full CI build simply run `./test.sh`.
Note that you'll need to comment out the `git clone` in the build otherwise it will fail since you've mounted a directory there.
